# Precious Metals vs Cryptocurrencies analysis- [Hugo_analysis](https://github.com/nicoleanderson21/Project-3/blob/main/Hugo_analysis.ipynb) README

## Introduction

This anlaysis summarizes a detailed study that compares how well cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) have done compared to precious metals (Gold and Silver) over a few years. It uses different methods to evaluate price trends, returns on investment, and volatility.

## Files

The analysis is supported by visual aids, which include the following charts:

- `silver_price_trendline.png` - A focused view of the price trend line of Silver.
- `Volatility_Comparison.png` - A bar chart comparing the volatility (standard deviation of returns) of all four assets.

## Analysis Results

### Price Trends
- Linear regression analysis was applied to assess the overall price trend of each asset. Cryptocurrencies displayed a steeper slope, indicating a more rapid change in prices over time compared to precious metals.

### Returns on Investment (ROI)
- Yearly ROI calculations were plotted to compare the performance of the assets year over year. Cryptocurrencies had higher peaks and sharper falls, signifying higher potential returns but at greater risk.

### Volatility
- As expected, cryptocurrencies showed significantly higher volatility compared to precious metals, which aligns with the wider price swings observed in the crypto market.

### Statistical Significance
- T-tests were conducted to determine if there were statistically significant differences in the ROI of the assets. The results indicated no significant differences between the ROIs of Gold and Silver, and similarly, no significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Conclusion

The study shows that cryptocurrencies and precious metals behave very differently when it comes to investing. Precious metals, Gold and Silver are stable and good for protecting wealth. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer potential for big returns but come with higher risk due to their volatility.
Regarding limitations, it's important to note that we only looked at these assets for a few years, so we're only seeing a small part of the bigger picture. Additionally, we focused on the most popular metals and cryptocurrencies, but there are others out there that could tell a different story. Factors like major news events and economic changes could also impact these values, which we didn't include in our analysis.
